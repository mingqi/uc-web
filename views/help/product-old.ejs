                            MetricsAt is a cloud based service. It can be used to measure and monitor any data from your application. It’s very easy to use. The only thing you need to do is tell us where your data. Our efficient Agent will automatically collect data to our central cluster. Then aggregate and graph for you. Our alerter also can notify you when thresholds are crossed so you'll never miss important events.

                        <p>Currently we support three ways to collect your application data: log files, database query or shell command.</p>

                          <li>Log Files. Watch your log files. Filter and extract data by your specified Regular Express.</li>
                          <li>Database Query. Periodically execute you specified query statement ( SQL or Mongo).</li>
                          <li>Shell command. Periodically run you specified shell command in your host. For example, you can input <strong>'ls -1 /you/path/ | wc -l'</strong> to metric and monitor how much files are under directory.</li>
